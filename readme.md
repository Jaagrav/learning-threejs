# Three.js Journey

## About
In this project, I tried to basically make a copy of https://www.ilithya.rocks/

This project was made after watching Lesson 13 of [ThreeJS Journey](https://threejs-journey.xyz/) by Bruno Simon.

## Setup
Download [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).
Run this followed commands:

``` bash
# Install dependencies (only the first time)
npm install

# Run the local server at localhost:8080
npm run dev

# Build for production in the dist/ directory
npm run build
```
